CIS 3223 Software Design Project

Going Through The Dungeon with Dragonsâ„¢ is a new, exciting one-player web game where the player's mission is to get through a maze, fight/be-friend dragons, and in the end, defeat the BO$$ dragon who has been terrorizing the land. The game has multiple levels that are emphasized by the level of difficulty of the dragon. There are easy, medium, and hard dragons, and one final Bo$$ dragons. The harder the dragon, the greater its power and the larger number attack the player must offer. (#we should specify this).
