Going Through The Dungeon with Dragonsâ„¢ is a new, exciting one-player web game where the player's mission is to get through a maze, fight/be-friend dragons, and in the end, defeat the BO$$ dragon who has been terrorizing the land. The game has multiple levels that are emphasized by the level of difficulty of the dragon. There are easy, medium, and hard dragons, and one final Bo$$ dragons. The harder the dragon, the greater its power and the larger number attack the player must offer. 		
		
		
The trivia game: when a dragon, other than the BO$$ dragon is defeated, the player will be given the option to "befriend" the dragon. To "befriend" the dragon, the player will have to answer trivia questions. All questions must be answered correctly for the friendship. If he player befriends the dragon, this dragon's power will be added to the player's to aid her in defeating the next dragons and is especially important to defeat the BO$$.
